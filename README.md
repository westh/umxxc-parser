# @westh/umxxc-parser

Parse messages from UMxxC devices, that is for instance the UM24C, UM25C, or the UM34C.

This parser is a derivative of these guys' work:

- [bzgex/UM34C_BT](https://github.com/bzgec/UM34C_BT)
- [kolinger/rd-usb](https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb)
- [sebastianha/um34c](https://github.com/sebastianha/um34c)

Whereas the above repos provide a complete 'suite' for getting and parsing the data from a UMxxC device this is merely the parser.

## Installation

```
npm install @westh/umxxc-parser
```

## Usage

```javascript
const umxxcParser = require('@westh/umxxc-parser')

const messageToBeParsed = Buffer.from('...') // ...however you get your data from the UMxxC device
const parsedMessage = umxxcParser.parse(messageToBeParsed)
```

The `parsedMessage` will contain something that looks like the following:

```javascript
{
  model: 'UM34C',
  voltage: 4.84, // [V] for UM25C this value will be decivolts
  current: 25, // [mA] for UM25C this value will be tenth-milliamps
  power: 121, // [mW]
  temperature: {
    celsius: 23,
    fahrenheit: 74
  },
  selectedGroup: 0,
  groups: [
    { accumulatedCurrent: 2, accumulatedPower: 10 }, // [mAh] [mWh]
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 },
    { accumulatedCurrent: 0, accumulatedPower: 0 }
  ],
  usbDataPlus: 0.04, // [V]
  usbDataMinus: 0.03, // [V]
  chargingMode: 7,
  accumulatedCurrent: 2, // [mAh]
  accumulatedPower: 10, // [mWh]
  thresholdCurrent: 0, // [A] and is the threshold at which accumulated... is captured
  accumulatedTime: 390, // [s]
  connected: 1,
  screenTimeout: 1,
  screenBrightness: 3,
  resistance: 193.6, // [â„¦]
  screenMode: 2,
  unknown: <Buffer 15 d4>
}
```

## Description

Basically the parser does what is described below to whatever `Buffer` you might throw at it. The calculations mentioned in the 'Meaning' column are taken care of, *except for the edge cases for the UM25C which are not handled at the moment*.
